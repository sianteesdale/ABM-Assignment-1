## Agent Based Model

This repository is made for an assignment at the University of Leeds for the module *Programming for Social Sciences*. The ABM is created using Python and is simulating the characteristics of sheep in a field.

To use this code, all files within this repository must be downloaded.
- model.py - has the base model required for the ABM
- agentframework.py - defines the class Agent for the model
- in.txt - has the relevant environment data for the ABM

When running the code in some Python applications, the following piece of code may be used to make the animation run in a pop-out window:
**%matplotlib qt**

That line of code must be ran in the console, as it will not work within the script. A note of this has been made at the bottom of the model if forgotten.
